            <title>Virtual Analog Modeling using Wave Digital Filters: a Tutorial Introduction</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, the basics of the &amp;quot;Wave Digital Filter&amp;quot; (WDF) approach to virtual analog modeling will be presented. The WDF concept was introduced as a generic digital filter design technique by Alfred Fettweis in the 1970s, and has been picked up slowly by the audio DSP community starting in the early 2000s. Today, WDFs are capable of modeling audio circuits with complex topologies (bridges, feedback, &amp;amp;c.) and multiple nonlinearities (diodes, transistors, &amp;amp;c.) and can be considered one of the main approaches to modeling audio circuits in software. A wide variety of audio circuits have been successfully modeled, including the Roland TR-808 bass drum, amplifier tone stacks, Ibanez Tube Screamer, OTA-based state variable filters, tone boosters, the Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi, the Korg MS-50 VCF, &amp;amp; Fender and Mesa Boogie preamplifiers. The main focus of the talk will be the basic mathematical concepts that underpin WDF modeling and tutorial examples, including a simple RC lowpass filter &amp;amp; the Hammond organ vibrato&#x2F;chorus circuit. Some progress on modeling a mysterious analog filter from the Experimental Music Studios (EMS) of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) will also be presented.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <title>We are moving to Zulip</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aes-erlangen.zulipchat.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;header.png&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everybody,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack has served us up until now as our chat, but we decided phasing out of Slack and moving to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zulip.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zulip&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (actually most content has already been moved). You can find us now at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aes-erlangen.zulipchat.com&quot;&gt;aes-erlangen.zulipchat.com&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the links on the website are already updated. This decision was made in the last Orga meeting, because:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zulip gives open access to the data and allows self-hosting&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is well established with TUM, University California San Diago or Rust language community as customers&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has streams with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zulip.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;streams-and-topics&quot;&gt;topics&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (+ integration of mailing lists)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a switch to Zulip is still possible without too much friction for our members&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any issues accessing the chat, don&#x27;t hesitate to contact us. We will also set up a warning sign on the Slack channel for others. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;small-faq&quot;&gt;Small FAQ&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#small-faq&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: small-faq&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m new, how can I join?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great to have you! Follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aes-erlangen.zulipchat.com&#x2F;register&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Sign up&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with an Email address at hand. You only have to provide minimal data, and after that should be able to log into Zulip.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I already had a Slack account, what do I have to do then?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances are high that you&#x27;re account was carried over, but not your password. (because this is not possible) Head to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aes-erlangen.zulipchat.com&#x2F;accounts&#x2F;password&#x2F;reset&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Forgot your password?&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and enter your Email address. After you got a reset Email, set a new password and log into Zulip with the usual URL. If you don&#x27;t get a reply, just create a new account (see first answer to FAQ).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pff I&#x27;m a bit overwhelmed with the new interface, where can I learn more?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No worries! You probably have opened the webinterface of Zulip, first take the tour of Zulip on their &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zulip.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;homepage&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. (like they do select a topic, for example in the &lt;code&gt;general&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; stream) Then view this short video on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=z2ADUqHDTKE&quot;&gt;Youtube&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. You should be ready to head into the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zulip.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;getting-started-with-zulip&quot;&gt;Getting Started&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; section of their help center and learn more about individual topics.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something is unclear, don&#x27;t hesitate to contact us, see you around!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital reproduction of the behaviour of analog electrical circuits such as synth filters or guitar amplifiers has been a common topic in music signal processing research since the mid-1990s. In the last several years the modern techniques of machine learning have started to be applied to this problem, producing very promising results. In parallel, the same time period has seen an explosion of work in the application of machine learning to solution of differential equations. This talk will give an overview of work in these closely connected fields, and explore how different application areas have influenced the type of solutions developed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you all had a good, happy beginning of new year! We just had the first orga meeting of 2022 and among other things discussed ideas for new events. If you are interested in joining or also have ideas please contact us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to host a regular open stage where people can show-case their current projects, prototypes or what they are interested in. The event is without any formalities and no additional preparation should be required for a stand up. It should primarily help people to connect and brainstorm with others.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have topic your excited about and want share with others?

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial reverberation is a classic audio processing technique to simulate the sonic effect of room acoustics by computational means. In contrast to physical modeling approaches, artificial reverberation does not aim to recreate the accurate physics but instead evoke a perceptually convincing or pleasing impression. Feedback delay networks (FDNs) provide a computationally low complexity solution to artificial reverberation required for virtual and augmented reality applications. This talk introduces digital, artificial reverberation basics, particularly FDNs, and discusses a few current trends and applications. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first event of the AES student section was a great success. Ulli gave an introduction working in the field of 3D audio. Among other things he went into details about the typical education of a Tonmeister in Germany, e.g. popular universities and specializations. Also the very diverse set of skills you can have while calling you a Tonmeister and his personal career in the field. Highlights of his work was part of the second half. For example he told the story how they made a live MPEG-H demo for the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 possible. We were happy to have such a diverse audience from Erlangen and Ansbach with students, researcher and people working in applied audio. See you next time!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most tonmeisters work in theatres, concert halls, in broadcast or other fields of the entertainment industry.
